# 5 benefits of moving to another country

I just moved back to my home country, France and I am so sad. Not only because I have left my boyfriend there in Norway, but also because I feel like my learning curve is going to be reversed. Being in a new country helped me to grow every day. After almost one and a half years, I still did not fall into the routine. So here are five reasons why moving to another country is beneficial for your personal growth.

### #1: You can be who you want to be

Moving to another country can also mean starting a new life. I came to Norway with a goal in mind, being who I wanted to be. I have grown so close to my family and have kept my friends for so long that it has become harder to change without facing the typical sentence:" Cyrielle, that's not you!". I realized I was only a projection of my parents' expectations, some parts of my brother and sister that I liked, without thinking about how people see me. Being in another country was a new start in my life, an opportunity to finally choose what fits best to my values, without having to explain to everyone why.

It all started with a new look, and then a new mindset, and after showing this new person to people, see their reactions, I finally built myself. That possibility to get a reboot has been the biggest turning point in my life as an adult. I highly recommend anyone to face the same. I feel so free now.

### #2: New Language

With a new country comes a new language. I arrived in Norway without knowing the work of Norwegian and without being fluent in English. Thus I discovered two languages while I was there (Norwegians are in general so good in English because they grew up with English movies/shows). I cannot deny that the first months were tiring. I was sleeping for more than 10 hours and dreaming in a mix of English and French.

However, it was such a great experience; going through the different steps, and seeing the progress every week is motivating.

I discover a new way of turning the sentences and thus a new way of thinking. Learning the common language helps a lot to be included in society, thus feel a bit more at home and actually see the country differently.

### #3: New food discovery

The first time I entered a supermarket in Trondheim, I decided that I had to buy something unknown each time. Some things were a real discovery and changed my food habits (like the caviar) but some others made me go through hard times. I forced myself to eat all the things I bought, which led me to eat brown cheese every day for two weeks. That was hard.

It's is interesting to see how fast you can change your habits. In France, I was used to Brioche & Nutella every morning. However, they are no brioche in Norway and it's rare to find Nutella. I had to switch to the local salty breakfast. It took me only a few weeks to get used to it. Now I would say it would be hard to go back to sweet breakfast.

Here is my top 10 of the food I discovered in Norway:

- Reindeer meat burger with raspberry jam
- Knackebrod with caviar and Norwegia cheese
- Riskrem
- Meatballs with mashed potatoes
- Jarlsberg cheese
- Taco Friday
- Kjeks og ost - TUC with cheese
- Kannelboller
- Warm Waffles with jam and creme fraiche
- Bred with Leverpostei

### #4: New people around you

I believe that most of my choices have been influenced by the people surrounding me. Moving to another country is a way to renew your surrounding and define who is going to influence your life. And not only in a negative way. You can also decide to be surrounded by people that motivate you to do something basic like working out or something more special like starting a company. You can become better, by learning from others.

Going abroad is also a good way to take distance from your old like, turn the page and start focusing on the new life you are going to start. In a way, you get another chance to make your life more enjoyable and satisfying, and to experiment to find what is best for you.

### #5: Extend your comfort zone

If like me you are tired of always feeling comfortable and want to extend your comfort zone, living in a foreign country is perfect. For all the reasons I mentioned before, you'll push your limits and grow up. It's not an easy thing but it's such satisfying when you feel at home in a new country.
