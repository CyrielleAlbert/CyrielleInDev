# Useby - An entrepreneurship project that never saw the light of day.

## The concept of Useby

Useby was a mobile application that aimed to help consumers to reduce the waste of food at home. It acted in 3 different ways:
  - 1. Warning: It notifies the consumer when a product is close to its expiry date.
  - 2. Solving: The user can share a product close to the expiry date on a free food marketplace to exchange or give it to another user who might need it.
  - 3. Prevention: To avoid making the same mistakes again and waste more food, the user is given a personalized shopping list based on the actual needs of the house.
  
## The different stages of the development

### 1. Define the problem

   With the help of the incubator ESEO Start, we worked on defining a problem faced by a large number of people but that has no proper solution. After few weeks of examination and questioning our own lives, we came up with several problems we were personally facing. It is way easier to work on one of our problems as we will be the first client. Of course, it's important not to think that your opinion is one of all your targeted clients or you might be badly surprised after the launch.

   With a list of potential problems, we went to talk to few people from different generations around us. The idea was to find which of our problems have also been faced by other people (we did not want to go for a niche market). To make it more accurate, I would advise you not to talk directly about the problems you have found or your questions might be biased. After all, food waste at home appeared to be the most valuable one.
  
### 2. Understand the causes with the targeted clients

   Once the problem was defined, we analyzed our targeted market's behavior to figure out what the reasons for food waste are. We also analyzed the behavior of people who don't face that issue to find key behaviors that could be implemented to solve the problem.

### 3. Define a solution with the targeted clients

   After a lot of analysis and work, we went back to our potential customers. We presented them how we imagined helping them, we gathered feedback of what they like/dislike until we could get a first draft of the concept.

### 4. Build an MVP

   A few months later, we build an MVP (Most Valuable Product) with the key functionalities implemented and not more. The goal was to give it to our potential customers and gather feedback again to keep them in the loop to build something they will use.

## Why it has never been released

Useby was a project we built in parallel to our MSc in Engineering. We tried to spend as much time as possible on it but the internships and Homeworks made it hard to deliver a product. Some already big companies have implemented a similar solution which led us to abandon the idea and jump on something else. I think that it's smarter to work with other companies to solve the problems I care about instead of taking the risk to build a company that will compete against more popular companies.

## A Teamwork

I did not work alone on this project. I worked with my friend Pierre Bertier who I also studied with. Pierre worked more on the technical side while I was working more on the business side of the project.
