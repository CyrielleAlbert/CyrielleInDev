# Protolk - a web application for professional networking
## The concept

Protolk is a web application that aims to simplify professional networking. Based on the concept of speed dating, it offers a safe place to meet exciting professionals. It can be used to hire, discover other domains, talk with similar profiles or even to get inspired. The only requirement to use it, is to connect with a LinkedIn(c) account, a great way to have a safe place.

## The technologies used

The goal of this project was to learn ReduxJS and WebRTC. I used ReactJS to build the web application with an ExpressJS server that for now, runs locally. (The server is only a Signaling server for the WebRTC).
