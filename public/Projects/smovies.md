## The concept

Smovies is a new social network for cinephile. The idea is to offer fans of cinema a safe place to inspire others and get inspired for movies suggestions. 
The main concept is to group movies, create movies "mood boards" and share them with others. Based on how the users' group movies together, Smovies will be able to suggest movies and open minds with unexpected suggestions. 
As I had one month between the last day of work and the beginning of my studies, I put as a deadline to launch the MVP (minimum viable product) the first week of February, right before starting to study. 
So the goal was to build something as complete as possible but at the same time as stable as possible.

## The technologies used

I decided to build this web app to learn React.Js and Firebase utilities like Authentication and Real-Time Databases.
In order to have a large database of movies, I used the Open Source API [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
I also learned how to use Figma software for designing the app before coding and I got initiated to UI/UX design.

## The stages of the development

In order to reach the goal, I divided the work into 4 different steps:
    - 1. UI/UX design with interested cinephiles
    - 2. Definition of the essential features 
    - 3. Development + testings 
    - 4. Final Launch on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/smovies)

## Overview of the results

Despite the short time to develop the project, the result was overall satisfying. One month after the launch, the database counted a bit more than 50 accounts from people I don't know. However, only 10 boards were created and most of them were made of one movie only. 
Today [first of July 2021], I can count almost 100 accounts created, but no daily users. 
The app is clearly not interesting the way it is now, even if, apparently, the idea was good.

## Field of improvements

The trickiest thing with building this app is that the most interesting functionality for users needs data to be implemented. Indeed, in order to develop the suggestions algorithm, I need boards to base it on. I thought people would still be interested in building boards but it was not the case. 
It can be because the app is not usable right now on mobile. 
In addition to that, the website is pretty slow due to lots of requests and heavy pictures which make the UX worse.

So, Smovies needs a lot of work still, but it seems that the idea beside was good. It's definitely a project I will work on more in the future.
