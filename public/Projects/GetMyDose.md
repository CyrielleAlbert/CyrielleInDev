# @GetMyDose - a Telegram bot to get a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine

## The concept

@GetMyDose is a Telegram bot. This bot gives the user a notification when a dose of vaccine is available in the next 24 hours, with the information about the doses available (vaccination center, date, link to book the appointment).
The idea came from [someone](github.com) which is a simple script to gather information from Doctolib. I only had to adapt the script for my city and implement the logic of the Telegram bot instead of the Discord server. 

## The technologies used

- Backend: Python V 3.8.5
- Bot: [Python Telegram Bot](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## The results
It might be unbelievable but this bot became viral in my university. Indeed, at the beginning of May, the young people (18-40yo) could only book an appointment to get a dose of vaccine within the 24 hours. As people were always cancelling and taking appointments, it got hard to actually be able to get a dose even if there were lots of leftovers at the end of the day.
