# Telegram Bots

### About the project

The telegram bots are part of a project that I called "One weekend - One project".
I started this project during the first corona lockdown as I needed to find something to do during the weekends.
The goal was to work every weekend on a new project and create a Minimum Valuable Product (MVP) in two days.
I had in mind to do it for one month... but I actually did it only for twice as I needed to do some extra hours for the company I worked with.

For this project, I used Python and the Telegram library.

### News Master Bot

**What is it?**

It's a bot that can give you the 10 last articles for a special country or keyword.

**Why this project?**

I was living in Norway and I usually used Google News to check the news in France. So I wanted to be able to choose which country.

**What I learned:**

- HTTP requests
- How to build a telegram bot
- How to use the News API
- How to create a local server to run the backend of the bot

### Master Chef Bot

**What is it?**

It's a bot that gives you the 5 random recipes. You can also search for a special dish.

**Why this project?**

I used to weekly plan my next meals and I really needed diversity in my dished. So I decided to create that bot to give me ideas.

**What I learned:**

- Learned more about telegram bot (create buttons and interactions)
- Use another API for food recipes
